# US-Accident-Analysis-2016-2022
In this data set the total accident datas are given from 2016 to march 2023 of USA. I have done exploratory data anlysis to find out various insights which may be direct or indirect factor for the accidents.
## **Summary and Conclusion**
#### New York city is not present in the dataset.
#### Miami, Houston, Los Angeles, Charlotte, Dallas are some of the cities with highest no. of accidents reccorded.
#### No. of cities with high accidents are 1218, ie only 8.9%
#### No. of cities with low accidents are 12460 ie only 91.1%
#### Max no of accidents are in the morning (6am -8am) and in evening (3pm -6pm).May be because it is the peak hour of the day as most people go out and return home from work place in this time only.
#### Weekends have less accidents alsmost half of the average weekdays accidents.
#### Clearly no. of accidents in sunday is more between the time 11am to 6pm. Maybe people start their day late during on sunday
#### Weekdays and Weekends have different distribution of accidents. In weekdays peak is in genarlly Morning and Evening while in Weekends peak seems to be in afternoon.
#### Mostof the accidents have taken place in Fair, cloudy and clear day. Very less accident on rainy, foggy days. Probably because people travel more in clear, fair days and travel less in rainy days.
